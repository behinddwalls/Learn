Motivation and Scope:

There are common situations when classes differ only in their behavior. 
For this cases is a good idea to isolate the algorithms in separate classes 
in order to have the ability to select different algorithms at runtime. 

Intent:
Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. 
Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
